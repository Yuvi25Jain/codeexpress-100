Question:

At a busy train station, there are n passengers standing in a queue to buy tickets. The 0th passenger is at the front of the queue, and the (n - 1)th passenger is at the back.

You are given a 0-indexed integer array tickets of length n, where tickets[i] represents the number of tickets the i-th passenger wants to purchase.

Each passenger can buy only one ticket per second. After buying a ticket, if they still need more tickets, they must go to the end of the line. If a passenger has purchased all the tickets they need, they leave the queue.

Your task is to determine the total time it takes for the passenger at position k to finish purchasing all their tickets.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases.
For each test case:
The first line contains n (the number of passengers in line) and k (the position of the passenger you are tracking).
The second line contains an array tickets of length n, where tickets[i] represents the number of tickets the i-th passenger wants to buy.
Constraints

1 <= T <= 1000
1 <= n <= 100
1 <= tickets[i] <= 100
0 <= k < n
Output Format

For each test case, print the total time (in seconds) taken for the passenger at position k to finish buying all their tickets.

First round: Every passenger buys one ticket → Line becomes [1, 2, 1]
Second round: Every remaining passenger buys one ticket → Line becomes [0, 1, 0]
The person at position 2 has successfully bought 2 tickets and it took 3 + 3 = 6 seconds.

Explanation 1

Everyone buys one ticket in the first round.

Person at position 3 gets their ticket in 4 seconds.
