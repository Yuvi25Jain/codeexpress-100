Question : 

Lakshya Sen and Kidambi Srikanth are competing in a high-stakes badminton match. The match is played with two shuttle reserves, numbered 1 and 2. Shuttle Reserve 1 contains X shuttlecocks, while Shuttle Reserve 2 contains Y shuttlecocks.

Lakshya Sen starts the game.

On his turn, Lakshya can either:

Take 1 shuttlecock from both reserves
Take 2 shuttlecocks from Reserve 1
On his turn, Kidambi can either:

Take 1 shuttlecock from both reserves
Take 2 shuttlecocks from Reserve 2
The player who cannot make a move loses the match. Determine who will win if both players play optimally.

Input Format

The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers X and Y, representing the initial number of shuttlecocks in reserves 1 and 2, respectively.
Constraints

1≤T≤1000
1≤X,Y≤10^9
Output Format

For each test case, output "Lakshya" if Lakshya Sen wins the game, and "Kidambi" otherwise.

1 10
Sample Output 0

Kidambi
Explanation 0

Test Case 1:

Lakshya removes 1 shuttlecock from both reserves. Reserve 1 is empty, while Reserve 2 has 9 shuttlecocks left.
Kidambi removes 2 shuttlecocks from Reserve 2. Reserve 1 is still empty, and Reserve 2 has 7 shuttlecocks left.
Since Lakshya cannot make a move, Kidambi wins.
Test Case 2:

Lakshya removes 1 shuttlecock from both reserves. Now, each reserve has 1 shuttlecock left.
Kidambi removes 1 shuttlecock from both reserves, making both reserves empty.
Since Lakshya cannot make a move, Kidambi wins.
Test Case 3:

Lakshya plays optimally and ensures he wins the match.
