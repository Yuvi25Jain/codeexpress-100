Question :


Alex has a lawn with different grass heights. He needs to trim the grass until all parts of the lawn are even. However, he follows a special rule:

In one turn, Alex cuts the smallest non-zero grass height from all uncut areas at the same time.
He continues cutting until the entire lawn is trimmed to zero height.
Can you help Alex find the minimum number of turns needed to fully mow the lawn?

Input Format

The first line contains T, the number of test cases.
For each test case:
The first line contains an integer n, the number of lawn patches.
The second line contains n space-separated integers representing the grass height of each patch.
Constraints

1 <= T <= 1000
1 <= n <= 10^5
0 <= nums[i] <= 10^5
Output Format

For each test case, print the minimum number of turns needed to mow the lawn completely.

First turn: Cut 1 unit from all grass patches → [0, 4, 0, 2, 4]
Second turn: Cut 2 units → [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]
Third turn: Cut 2 units → [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Since the entire lawn is mowed, minimum turns = 3.

The lawn is already fully trimmed, so no turns are needed!
